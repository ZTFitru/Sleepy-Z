# üõå Sleepy Z 

## Abstract:

- While attending Turing, I was assigned to create a web application for users to search for hotel rooms by filtering them by date and room type. The user logs in when they first land on the page. The username was `customer<id>`, the `id` is the unique identifier for the customer. Once they are logged in, they are prompted to a booking page where they are able to select a room they want to book. 

## Installation Instructions:

1. Select `fork`.
2. Decide where you want to clone this repo in `YOUR` terminal.
3. Select the `Code` button and copy the `SSH` provided.
4. `YOUR` terminal command should look like the line below.
5. `git clone git@github.com:ZTFitru/Sleepy-Z.git`
6. Move into the directory using `cd [dir_name]`.
7. Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install dependencies.

### To Run
1. Run `npm start` in terminal to see the HTML file
2. copy `http://localhost:8080` from the terminal and paste it in your browser
3. To stop running the local server, use `control + c` in the terminal

### To Test
- In the terminal run `npm test`

## Learning Goals:

- `Data Manipulation`: Use object and array prototype methods.
- `User Interface`: Create a clear and accessible UI.
- `Network Requests`: Retrieve data via network requests.
- `Testing`: Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- `Code Quality`: Write DRY, reusable code following the SRP.


### Wins + Challenges üèÜ:
- Wins
  - Removing a booking once a user selects the room was one of the best feeling to see on the screen.

- Challenges
  - One challenge I came across in the beginning was having the booking page show up before the log in. It wouldn‚Äôt update the users data if they weren't logged in, to fix that issue, I changed the set up of the HTML      to have the logging page show up before the booking page.
